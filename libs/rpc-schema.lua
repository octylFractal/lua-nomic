[[ An RPC connection is a bidirectional DAG of messages. Messages are packed into a packet and sent over the wire in a prioritized topographical order.
When packets arrive, their contents are deserialized and the dag is reconstructed, possiby including holes from missing packets.
The acknowledgement system must retransmit any dropped packets so that eventually all holes are filled or the connection fails and subsequent calls error.
The reciever will take deserialized messages in prioritized topographical order, delaying any holes until they are filled and holding messages until their dependencies are dispatched.

These properties are fulfilled if the packets are a simple ordered reliable stream, however the performance decreases dramatically, so building on top of a protocol that permits unordered and/or unreliable transport is desirable.
Thus, the main implementation of this protocol will be UDP based.
